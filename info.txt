Goal: Use California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. Model should learn from this data and predict
the median housing price in any district.

Objective: Results of this model (a prediction of the median housing price in a district) is fed to another machine learning system.

System:
- Supervised training since the data comes with the output, a district's median housing price.
- Regression task since the model predicts a value based on features (district's population, median income, etc.) 
- Univariate regression problem since we are predicting a single value for each district

- root mean square error performance measure & mean absolute error

Data set
- 80% of the dataset will be used for training
- 20% of the dataset will be used for testing
- Median income plays a big role when determining median housing price
- Most districts are in a particular subset of median income, thus, the test set must be stratified 
  to guarantee a close representation of the overall population

Data set cleanup
- total_bedrooms attribute in the data set contains NaN values, so we'll use imputation to fill in the median
  for these values
